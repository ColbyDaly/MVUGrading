* Download the .zip file of this project on GitHub

* “Save As” the spreadsheet from the judges in a .csv format

* Rename the downloaded spreadsheet to spreadsheet.csv and move it into the same folder as MVUProject.JAR (the program won’t run without the correct name)

* Remove the comments column from the downloaded spreadsheet. The commas in the comments section are not compatible with a .csv file. 

* Run the jar file, and results.csv will be created. 

* MVUProject.jar creates a spreadsheet that shows:

Top scores from all grades (7-12)
Top scores from middle school (7-8)
Top 5 scores for each category (Physics/Math, Biology, Chemistry, Social Sciences, Energy-Engineering-Geology-Envi)
